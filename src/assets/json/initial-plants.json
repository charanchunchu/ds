Further research into their properties could potentially reveal them as a pleasant and useful ingredient in cases where mild nervous exhaustion requires a diffusible stimulant and relaxant.

A fluid extract can be created by processing one pound of cubeb powder in a sealed percolator with ether until one quart has been collected. After distilling off one and a half pints of the ether and allowing the rest to evaporate naturally, a brownish or greenish oleoresin is left behind. This oleoresin can be consumed in doses of five to fifteen drops on sugar. Cubeb Berry is renowned for its carminative, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant, and antiseptic properties. Studies have shown that Cubeb Berry is effective in alleviating the symptoms of chronic bronchitis. It is also used to treat digestive ailments and has proven efficacy against dysentery.

The levels of these compounds vary in the fruit, latex, leaves, and roots of the papaya plant. Papaya has been traditionally used for digestive issues and intestinal worms. The softening and disintegrating properties of papain (typically in alkaline combination with substances like borax or potassium carbonate) have been utilized in the treatment of warts, corns, sinuses, chronic scaly eczema, cutaneous tubercles, and other skin conditions caused by irritation. Additionally, it has been injected into non-active glandular tumors to facilitate their absorption."

A tincture of cubebs can be made by macerating (or percolating) four ounces of the berries with a quart of diluted alcohol, and a dose of half a fluid drachm or more may be taken. A fluid extract can be created by processing one pound of cubeb powder in a sealed percolator with ether until one quart has been collected. After distilling off one and a half pints of the ether and allowing the rest to evaporate naturally, a brownish or greenish oleoresin is left behind.

      "uses": " Ambrette seeds originate from a tropical hibiscus plant. These seeds contain an oil that has a slightly amber, fatty-musky scent. The main components responsible for its fragrance are the macrocyclic musks 5(Z)-tetradecen-14-olide and 7(Z)-hexadecen-16-olide, also known as ambrettolide [6]. In the past, this oil was highly valued in the perfume industry, but it has been largely replaced by synthetic musks. The seeds have a strong musky aroma and were traditionally referred to as grani moschi. They have been credited with both relaxing and stimulating properties. There have even been documented cases where they appeared to have a significant impact in counteracting snake venom. Further research into their properties could potentially reveal them as a pleasant and useful ingredient in cases where mild nervous exhaustion requires a diffusible stimulant and relaxant. Currently, their primary use seems to be adding flavor to Arab coffee. The seeds can also be used for inhalation purposes to alleviate hoarseness and throat dryness. Also, the leaves and roots are used to treat gonorrhea and venereal diseases."
